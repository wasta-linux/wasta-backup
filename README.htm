<h3>Wasta Backup version 0.1.3 2013-06-07</h3>

<p>Wasta Backup is a simple backup GUI using rdiff-backup for version backups of data to an external USB device.

<p>Restore possibilities include restoring previous versions of files or folders as well as restoring deleted files or folders from the backup device.
In the case of restoring previous versions of existing items, the current item is first renamed using the current date and time.

<p>Additionally, a 'Restore ALL' option is available that will replace all data on the computer from the backup device.

<p>Settings are stored in a user's ~/.config/wasta-backup/ directory:

<ul>
    <li><p><b>backupDirs.txt:</b> specifies directories to backup and other parameters such as number of versions to keep</li>

    <li><p><b>backupInclude.txt:</b> specifies file extensions to backup (so media extensions, etc., will be politely ignored)</li>

    <li><p><b>useBackupIncludeFilter.txt:</b> determines whether or not backupInclude.txt is used</li>

</ul>
