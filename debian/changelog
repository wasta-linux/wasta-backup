wasta-backup (1.0.10) xenial; urgency=medium

  * jcl: only autolaunch on USB drive insertion, not all block devices

    Previously the udev rule launched on any SUBSYSTEM that was       
    considered a block device, including normal drive partitions.
    This could be triggered by creating a /media/wasta-offline folder
    for example.

    USB seems like the only kind of device insertion that we are      
    interested in auto-launching wasta-offline.

wasta-backup (1.0.9) wily; urgency=medium

  * wasta-backup-udev: account for machines that have "broken at" due to
    remastersys throwing away the config file /var/spool/cron/atjobs/.SEQ
    Without that file, at doesn't work and autolaunch is broken. Fixed
    by running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure at", but patching here so if that
    file isn't found, we revert to the old method of launching wasta-backup.
    WARNING: if using 15.10+ and that file doesn't exist, the old method
    is used, then automount of ALL USBs is broken.  So we need to ensure
    that wasta-remastersys properly configs "at" in the firstboot script.

wasta-backup (1.0.8) trusty; urgency=medium

wasta-backup (1.0.7) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Restore ALL needs to "mkdir -p" on the restore folder, as
    it may several layers (of non-existing subfolders) deep.  Normal restore
    won't need this because am starting from the immediate parent folder.
  * Added '2>&1' to shellRun commands so that warnings and errors both
    returned and sent to logfile.
  * Added quotes to 'Restore All' rsync command to restore .config/wasta-backup
  * Added 'sync' commands to restore processes
