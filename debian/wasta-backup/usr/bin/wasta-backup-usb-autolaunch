#   This script takes a device id as input, finds the mount point of the device
#       from df, determines the owner of the device, and finally launches
#       wasta-backup on the device owner's x display server.
#
#   2013-06-24: Initial script
#   2013-06-28: updated to apply gtk+ style (needed for Ubuntu, for some
#       reason works correctly w/o that on Mint)
#   2013-08-12: removed .sh extension to comply with debian packaging standard
#   2013-10-14: reduced sleep delay to 5s
#
