Wasta Backup is a simple backup GUI using rdiff-backup for version backups of data to an external USB device.

Wasta Backup will auto-launch when a USB device with a previous Wasta Backup on it is inserted.

Restore possibilities include restoring previous versions of existing files or folders as well as restoring deleted files or folders from the backup device. In the case of restoring previous versions of existing items, the current item is first renamed using the current date and time.

Additionally, a 'Restore ALL' option is available that will replace all data on the computer from the backup device.
