Wasta Backup is a simple backup tool using rdiff-backup for version backups
of data to an external USB device.

Restore possibilities include restoring previous versions of files or folders
as well as restoring deleted files or folders from the backup device.  In the
case of restoring previous versions of existing items, the current item is
first renamed using the current date and time.

Additionally, a 'Restore ALL' option is available that will replace all data
on the computer from the backup device.
